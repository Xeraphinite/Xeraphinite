## ❓ TMI

My interests span a broad spectrum of (indoor) subjects including playing arcade rhythm games, drifting in CJK languages, and consuming CJK-specific media.

I am fascinated with both arcade rhythm games, especially BEMANI series like Beatmania IIDX, Sound Voltex, and pop’n music, PC games such as DJMAX Respect V, EZ2ON, (and previously OSU!), and mobile games like Arcaea.

Languages are another part of my life—I grew up speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, and Teochew Dialect, studied Japanese to JLPT N1, and recently started learning Korean and Hokkien. I hope one day I can move smoothly between all CJK languages, both in daily life and in research without barriers.

As an indoor nerd, I spent lots of my precious time in consuming media contents. For music, I prefers to listen K-pop, J-pop, VOCALOID, and doujin music. And for podcasts, movies, dramas, books, as well as other games, I also mainly focused on CJK regions. Recently, I enjoyed watching *Hamaguchi Ryusuke*’s movie such as PASSION, *Sang-soo Hong*’s *What does that nature saids to you*, *Ya-chuan Hsiao*’s *Old Fox*, *Bakarhythm*’s *Hotspot*, and waiting for *Kirby Air Riders* and Nintendo Switch 2. The adorable Kirby always got my attention 😇.
